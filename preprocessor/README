The preprocess.pl script is used to turn large CSVs collected from statsCan
into small files usable by the main program.
Instructions:
1. Download the StatsCan CPI CSV from here:
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1810000413
Select 'download options' and then 'CSV/Download entire table'

2. (OPTIONAL) If answering question 2, download Canadian Census Data from here:
https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/download-telecharger/comp/page_dl-tc.cfm?Lang=E
Select 'Canada, provinces, territories, census divisions and census subdivisions/CSV/

3. Drag the CSV you desire to have processed into the preprocessor folder

4. Run preprocessor.pl in the following format:
'perl preprocessor.pl <FILENAME.csv> <QUESTIONNUMBER>'
for instance, if you wished to preprocess the CPI for question 1, you might enter
'perl preprocessor.pl statsCPI.csv 1'

5. Wait for your file to process - when it's done, it will appear in the same folder as the perl file with the format
'priceIndex<Number>.csv', or in the case of the census data, 'censusData.csv'

6. Drop the file into the 'lib' folder, and then run main.pl in the src folder
