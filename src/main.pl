#   Functional Summary
#   main.pl takes in data from the consumer price index to answer the following question:
#   Over the course of an average year, how have month-to-month trends affected the cost of
#   education and alcohol per province? What correlations can we find between the cost of alcohol
#   And the cost of education in an average month?
#
#   Statistics data from:
#

#
#   Variables to be used
#
my @productName; #this holds all the product names
my @averageCost; #this holds all the CPI values (balanced around 1)
my @provinceName; #this holds all the respective province names
my @monthType; #this holds all the months of the year
